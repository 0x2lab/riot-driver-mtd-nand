This directory provides some porting information for libraries and programs to
use with RIOT (to build an external module). If you like add a package to RIOT
you need to add directory to this directory with the name of your package. This
directory should contain at least to files:
 * patch.txt    - Your patch of the upstream project of the package to make it
                  build with RIOT
 * Makefile     - A Makefile describing how to get the upstream project, apply
                  the patch and how to build the package as a RIOT module.
                  a rough template for several methods of aquiring a package
                   is provided in Makefile.git, Makefile.http, and Makefile.svn
